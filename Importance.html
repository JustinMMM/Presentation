        <h2>So, how are they important?</h2>
		<p align="justify"> What do you mainly think of when you see a bee? An insect? Some type of animal that you cannot disturb while it's working? Well there are many considerations you can add when you see a bee but the main one that comes to mind is that of course it's nature. Bees aren't decreasing as bad as people may think but it is still a worry, despite the small number of bees disappearing this is causing major issues in nature. How will other animals collect nectar besides butterflies and other animals?
		
		Bees and other small mammals that pollinate plants are responsible for bringing us one out of every three bites of food. They also sustain our ecosystems and produce our natural resources by helping plants reproduce.

                <h2>What do they do to help?</h2>
				<p align="justify"> Bees travel from plant to plant carrying pollen on their bodies in a vital interaction that allows the transfer of genetic material critical to the reproductive system of most flowering plants – the very plants that

					Bring us countless fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
					½ of the world’s oils, fibers and raw materials;
					Prevent soil erosion.
					Increase carbon sequestration
					The honey bees are experiencing a run of bad luck. Between pesticides, fungus, mite infestations, natural disasters, and global warming they just can't catch a break. Did you know that Honey bees are the most important pollinators for flowers, fruits and vegetables? This means that they help other plants grow, and without them many of the food sources you enjoy each day would be gone. According to the NRDC In some regions, up to 90% of bees have disappeared!</p>

        <h2>More as to how they help</h2>
		<p align="justify">According to the Medical News Today website, they stated that bees show "The movement of pollen between plants is necessary for plants to fertilize and reproduce. Both farmed and wild bees control the growth and quality of vegetation — when they thrive, so do crops." Also another website entitled PerfectBee stated "In fact, bees are responsible for pollinating nearly 85% of all food crops for humans, as well as numerous crops that grow the food fed to cattle." Basically Bees are how species especially humans survived for many years. Without the bees many creatures and possibly humans wouldn't have managed to sustain crops, flowers, and just in general it would've been difficult for us. Have you ever had a sore throat, or just felt ill? Sometimes your parents make tea for you, or you make it yourself, people use honey from the bees which is healthy for our system. Honey can help us once again when we are sick and they can make sure viruses aren't causing problems.</p>
